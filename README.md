# LovenseJamFeb2023 - Hornyships
Entry for the Valentine's Vibes Lovense Jam 

A game of battleships that connects to lovense vibrators.

##Instructions on connecting your toys:
- Open your Lovense Remote's game mode (Me > Settings > Game Mode) and connect your toys.
- On the game, go to the Lovense Options menu and enter the local IP of your Lovense Remote.
- If everything is correct clicking on the test button should make your toys vibrate.
- Make sure both devices are on the same network.

##Instructions on creating or joining a game:
- On the play menu, select a region and give the room a name and create it, then send this room name to your partner so they can connect to the same room as you.
- If you leave the room name empty you will be matched with a random player on the selected region, or create a new room if no player is available.

##How to Play:
- Position all your ships (the pink rectangles) on your grid (the left one) and hit the "set ready" button, wait for your opponent to do the same.
- You can rotate your ships with the right mouse click.
- After both players are done with the setup the game begins, and you'll take turns trying to guess where your opponent's ships are.
- Once all tiles of a ship is hit the ship sinks, the first player to sink all oposing ships wins.
- You can open the menu with the TAB key.

The vibration score is constantly sent to your toys (if enabled), every time someone hits a ship the vibration score goes up by 50%, and overtime the score goes down (-5% per second, caps at 0%)
